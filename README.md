# Amazon-Clone-HTML---CSS
This project is a clone of the Amazon website, built using HTML and CSS. It demonstrates my skills in structuring web pages and creating responsive designs. The clone replicates the layout and design of Amazon's homepage, focusing on front-end development with a clean and user-friendly interface.
